# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Project Overview
This project involves implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an \( n \times n \) 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The task requires a clear understanding of matrix manipulation, in-place operations, and Python programming. The goal is to modify the matrix directly without using additional memory for another data structure.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- **Matrix Representation**: Understand how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python and learn how to access and modify individual elements.
- **In-place Operations**: Modify data structures directly to optimize space complexity and avoid creating unnecessary copies of the matrix.
- **Matrix Transposition**: Swap rows and columns to achieve a transposed version of the matrix, understanding its role in matrix rotation.
- **Row Reversal**: Reverse the order of elements in each row to complete the 90-degree rotation and learn efficient row manipulation techniques.
- **Nested Loops**: Use nested loops to iterate through 2D matrices and combine iteration with element modification for complex transformations.

## Requirements
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Python Version**: 3.8.10.
- **Code Style**: Pycodestyle (version 2.8.0).
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs.
- **Execution**: All files must be executable.
- **Documentation**: All modules and functions must be documented.
- **File Format**: Each file must end with a new line and begin with a shebang.

## Task Details

### Task 0: Rotate 2D Matrix
Write a Python function to rotate a given \( n \times n \) 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place.

#### Key Points:
- The function should not return anything; it must directly modify the input matrix.
- The matrix will always be 2-dimensional and non-empty.
- The operation must be completed in-place without using extra memory.
