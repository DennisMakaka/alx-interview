# 0x09. Island Perimeter

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of an algorithm to calculate the perimeter of an island represented in a 2D grid. The goal is to demonstrate an understanding of algorithm design and problem-solving skills using Python.

The task is commonly encountered in computational geometry and grid-based simulations, making it a fundamental algorithm for those exploring algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques.

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D grid consisting of `0`s (water) and `1`s (land), the task is to calculate the perimeter of the island formed by the `1`s. The perimeter is defined as the total length of the edges of the island that are not adjacent to water.
