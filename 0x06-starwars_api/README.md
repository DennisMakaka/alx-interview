# Star Wars API Project

## Project Overview
This project involves working with the Star Wars API to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters based on a given Movie ID. It is designed to enhance your skills in interacting with external APIs, handling asynchronous JavaScript code, and managing command-line arguments in Node.js.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Understand how to make HTTP requests using tools like the request module.
- Learn to interact with RESTful APIs and parse JSON data.
- Manage asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, or async/await.
- Work with command-line arguments in Node.js to customize script behavior.
- Manipulate arrays to process and display API response data effectively.

## Requirements
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Node.js Version**: 10.14.x.
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs.
- **Code Style**: Semistandard-compliant, following AirBnB style with semicolons.
- **Execution**: All files must be executable.
- **File Format**: Each file must end with a new line and start with a shebang.
- **Modules**: The request module must be used for HTTP requests.

## Task Details

### Task 0: Star Wars Characters
The objective is to create a script that fetches and displays all character names from a specified Star Wars movie. The character names should appear in the same order as listed in the `/films/` API endpoint.

#### Expected Features:
- Accepts a Movie ID as a command-line argument.
- Displays each character's name on a new line.
- Utilizes the Star Wars API for data retrieval.
- Uses the request module to make HTTP requests.


## Resources
- **HTTP Requests in Node.js**: Understand how to send HTTP requests using Node.js modules.
- **APIs in JavaScript**: Learn how to interact with external APIs and process JSON data.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Explore techniques for managing asynchronous operations, including promises and async/await.
- **Command-Line Arguments**: Familiarize yourself with handling user input via the command line in Node.js.

## Usage
To run the script, provide a Movie ID as a command-line argument. The script will fetch and display the character names associated with that movie.
